Hypertuning using validation

library("caret")
library("FNN")
library("class")


accuracy.df <- data.frame(k = seq(1, 20, 1), Accuracy = rep(0, 20))

train_Y <- factor(train_Y)
valid_Y <- factor(valid_Y)

# compute knn for different k on validation.
for(i in 1:20) {
  knn.pred <- knn(train_X, valid_X, 
                  cl = train_Y, k = i)
  accuracy.df[i, 2] <- confusionMatrix(knn.pred, valid_Y)$overall["Accuracy"] 
}
accuracy.df






```
Based on the validation accuracy k=1 has the highest accuracy of 96.2% showing that the model fits but could lead to overfitting. As k increases the accuracy drops a bit but remains high. Choosing a k=3  could provide a better balance between overfitting and ignoring useful information.k=3 is a good choice to balance bias and variance for this classification.

Confusion Matrix
```{r}
library("gmodels")

best_k <- 3

knn.best <- knn(train = train_X, test = valid_X, cl = train_Y, k = best_k)
CrossTable(x = valid_Y, y = knn.best, prop.chisq = FALSE)

```

Classify customer with best k
```{r}

prediction2 <- knn(train = train_X, test = new_customer, cl = train_Y, k = best_k)

print(paste("The customer classification is", prediction))
```
