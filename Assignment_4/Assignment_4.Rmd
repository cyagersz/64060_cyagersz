## Introduction
An equities analyst is studying the pharmaceutical industry and would like your help in exploring and understanding the financial data collected by her firm. Her main objective is to understand the structure of the pharmaceutical industry using some basic financial measures. Financial data gathered on 21 firms in the pharmaceutical industry are available in the file Pharmaceuticals.csv.

Questions:
Use cluster analysis to explore and analyze the given dataset as follows:
a. Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of clusters formed, and so on.
b. Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters.
c. Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in forming the clusters)
d. Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.

```{r}

library(tidyverse) 
library(factoextra) 
library(ISLR)
library(flexclust)

# Read the dataset
pharma <- read.csv("Pharmaceuticals.csv")
head(pharma)


# Just use the numerical variables 
pharma_num <- pharma[,3:11]

# Standardize the data so all variables have equal weight
pharma_scaled <- scale(pharma_num)

# Justification:
# Scaling makes sure that large-scale variables do not dominate smaller ones 
# This gives equal weight to each variable in clustering.
```
Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
```{r}
# Elbow method
fviz_nbclust(pharma_scaled, kmeans, method = "wss") +
  ggtitle("Elbow Method for Choosing Optimal Number of Clusters")

```

Based on the Elbow Method plot the total within-cluster sum of squares decreases sharply up to k = 3 and levels off afterward, indicating that 3 clusters is the optimal choice.
After Getting the most optimal k with the Elbow Method I use the kmeans method to for the clustering model.

```{r}
set.seed(123)  # ensures reproducibility
km3 <- kmeans(pharma_scaled, centers = 3, nstart = 25)

print("The Number of Companies in each Cluster")
print(km3$size)

print("The Number of Centers")
print(km3$centers)

fviz_cluster(km3, data = pharma_scaled) # Visualize the output

print(km3)

```
